Project 4 Option 1 - Ticket Purchase Application
================================================

#### Final Code and Deployment Due - During interactive grading appointment scheduled during (or before) finals week. Details will be posted on slack.

#### Checkpoint Due - December 5, 2018 - All students will be required to demonstrate their progress on or before the last day of class - December 5, 2018. Students who fail to demonstrate reasonable progress before this checkpoint will not receive credit for the Project Checkpoint criterion.

For this project you will implement a ticket purchase web application (i.e., your own EventBrite!). You will design and implement a two-tier web application with a Java (Jetty/Servlets) front end and an SQL backend.

| 10 | Code Style |  
| 15 | Code Quality |  
| 5 | Project Checkpoint |  

### Requirements

1. You will use Servlets/Jetty as your web framework.
2. You will use a SQL database to store all data including user information, event information, and ticket transaction/purchase information. You are required to design the database tables. 
3. By the time of your demonstration you must have your application deployed on the microcloud. The web site must be deployed on your [primary node](https://github.com/CS601-F18/notes/blob/master/admin/mcassignments.md) port **7070**. See the [guide to running on the microcloud](https://github.com/srollins/software-dev-materials/blob/master/notes/usf_guides/microcloud.md) to ensure that your process is long running.

### Submission Requirements

You will schedule an interactive grading appointment during finals week. Before your scheduled appointment, submit all code to your github repository for this assignment **and** ensure your complete solution is be running on the microcloud. Your server must be deployed on your [primary node](https://github.com/CS601-F18/notes/blob/master/admin/mcassignments.md) port **7070**. 

Use the following link to create your private github repository for this assignment: [Project 4](https://classroom.github.com/a/TdnexnOy)

For full credit, make sure to follow all [Style Guidelines](https://github.com/CS601-F18/notes/blob/master/admin/style.md). Points will be deducted for each violation.


### Academic Dishonesty

Any work you submit is expected to be your own original work. If you use any web resources in developing your code you are strongly advised to cite those resources. The only exception to this rule is code that is posted on the class website. The URL of the resource you used in a comment in your code is fine. If I google even a single line of uncited code and find it on the internet you may get a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class. You may also get a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class if your solution is at all similar to that of any other student.
